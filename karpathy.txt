
Stage 1: Pretraining
1. Download 10 TB of text
2. Get a cluster of 6,000 GPUs
3. Compress the text into a neural network, pay 2 million dollars, wait 12 days
4. obtain base model

Stage 2: Fine-tuning
1. Write labeling instructions
2. Hire people to collect 100K high quality ideal Q&A responses, and/or comparisons.
3. Finetune base model on this data, wait ~1 day.
4. Obtain assistant model
5. Run a lot of evaluations.
